## Problem Statement
In the rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape, consumers are often overwhelmed by the vast array of products available across multiple platforms. The challenge lies in the lack of a comprehensive tool that allows users to effectively search, compare, and analyze product data from various e-commerce websites. This results in a time-consuming process and often leads to less informed purchasing decisions.
Develop a Web/App Platform that scrapes product data from well- known e-commerce websites, aggregates and organizes the data, and provides users with intuitive tools to search, compare, and analyze product prices, features, and reviews across multiple platforms. Your solution should offer a seamless user experience and actionable insights to help users find the best deals and make informed purchasing decisions.
